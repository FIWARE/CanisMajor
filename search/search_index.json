The request should include information about the Wallet(e.g. Keystore) to be used for signing the transaction. Please check the API (tag NGIS-LD ) on how to send the transactions and provide the Wallet-Information. CanisMajor will create a Merkle-Tree from the send informations and include it as data into the transaction for the Blockchain. In order to properly sign the transaction, CanisMajor uses the provided Wallet-Information and delegates the signing to the client's Wallet. The signed transaction is then put into the Oketh-compatible blockchain. The current implementation of CanisMajor does not provide a direct integration into the Client-ContextBroker request flow. The client has to make a second call to CanisMajor in order to persist it through CanisMajor. As a temporary proxy-solution, a fork of the Wilma PEP Proxy can be used. Additional proxy integrations are planned, but not yet realized. Testing Run unit-tests via: mvn clean test A set of integration tests(using cucumber ) is available under it/ ). To run them use: cd it docker-compose -f docker-compose/docker-compose-env.yaml -f docker-compose/docker-compose-java.yaml up mvn clean test ADRs Delegate transaction signing to the client License CanisMajor is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
