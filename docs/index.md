# CanisMajor - FIWARE DLT Adaptor

![Current Architecture](https://github.com/FIWARE/CanisMajor/raw/master/docs/images/canis-major-overview.svg)

In order to persist transactions inside the blockchain, a client has to send information about its transactions(e.g. create/update/delete entity) to CanisMajor. 
The request should include information about the Wallet(e.g. Keystore) to be used for signing the transaction. Please check the [API](https://github.com/FIWARE/CanisMajor/tree/master/api/api.yaml)(tag `NGIS-LD`) on how to 
send the transactions and provide the Wallet-Information. CanisMajor will create a [Merkle-Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) from the send informations 
and include it as data into the transaction for the Blockchain. In order to properly sign the transaction, CanisMajor uses the provided Wallet-Information and delegates the
signing to the client's Wallet. The signed transaction is then put into the Oketh-compatible blockchain.

## Testing 

Run unit-tests via: ```mvn clean test```

A set of integration tests(using [cucumber](https://cucumber.io/)) is available under [it/](https://github.com/FIWARE/CanisMajor/tree/master/it)). 
To run them use:
```shell
    cd it
    docker-compose -f docker-compose/docker-compose-env.yaml -f docker-compose/docker-compose-java.yaml up
    mvn clean test
```
