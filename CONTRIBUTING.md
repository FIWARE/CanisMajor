# Contributing to CanisMajor

Thanks for checking out the CanisMajor Project. We're excited to hear and learn from you. We've put together the following
guidelines to help you figure out where you can best be helpful.

## Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/fiware/CanisMajor/issues) and
[pull requests](https://github.com/fiware/CanisMajor/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or
question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:

-   **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
-   **If your contribution is major,** such as a new guide, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can
    weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.

## Community

Discussions about the Open Source Guides take place on this repository's
[Issues](https://github.com/fiware/CanisMajor/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/fiware/CanisMajor/pulls)
sections. Anybody is welcome to join these conversations.

Wherever possible, do not take these conversations to private channels, including contacting the maintainers directly.
Keeping communication public means everybody can benefit and learn from the conversation.
